# SFDBScraper
A command-line tool for pulling data from Salesforce orgs

# Status
This project is currently on hold until I receive the "go ahead" from management. It seems more and more likely that they will need a tool like this soon. However, they also seem reluctant to ask me for something like this and I can only assume it's because they don't want to pay for it.

Last time I ran the program I was able to pull whatever data I wanted to from Salesforce all through a command line UI with prompts and menus. The menus may have been a little much and if I had to write this over I'd probably just build some sort of API for it instead of an intricate text based UI which was probably a bit overkill for what it needed to do.

So, try it out if you'd like. The retrieving of object data from Salesforce orgs works but you may need to write your own method of storing/accessing the data. If I'm remembering correctly, I wrote it so you can query the database and it will return an array of data.
